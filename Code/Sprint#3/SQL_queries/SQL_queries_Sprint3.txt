-> Measurement history of one sensor of type A, which is present in room B, within a time duration C

-> Current state of all actuators that are installed in every room
	- SELECT actuator.name AS Actuator, divisions.name AS Room, actuator.actuator_state AS State FROM actuator, divisions WHERE actuator.id_divisions = divisions.id;

->  Modify current state of every actuator of type D that exist in every room
	- UPDATE actuator SET actuator_state = 'ON' WHERE name = 'LIGHT'; SELECT actuator.name AS Actuator, divisions.name AS Room, actuator.actuator_state AS State FROM actuator, divisions WHERE actuator.name = 'LIGHT' AND actuator.id_divisions = divisions.id;

-> Considering only two sensor motes and two rooms, where each sensor mote is present in a different room, change the location of both sensor motes, so each room will be attributed with the sensor mote that was located in the other room

-> Modify the reference value of a sensor of type A in a given rule
	- UPDATE rules SET threshold_condition1 = 300 WHERE name_sensor_condition1 = 'LIGHT1';SELECT rules.id AS Rule, divisions.name AS Room, rules.threshold_condition1 AS Reference_Value, rules.name_sensor_condition1 AS Sensor FROM rules, divisions WHERE rules.id_divisions = divisions.id AND rules.name_sensor_condition1 = 'LIGHT1';
